Construction works for the third building are currently underway.  The monolithic frame has already been poured to 80 percent. External walls have been completed to 50%. Internal walls and partitions have been installed to 15%. Staircases and platforms have been poured up to the level of the eighth floor. Installation of PVC windows has begun in the building. Thanks to coordinated and organized work, construction is progressing rapidly, significantly ahead of the scheduled construction works.",
